# pitch-plunge-omp-noisyinflow

This code simulates the unsteady flow-fiield around a moving body, e.g. a pitching-plungig elliptic foil or an oscillating cylinder cylinder, with prescribed kinematics when subjected to a stochastic inflow.

Use the make file for compilation. Enter make in the terminal to compile the source codes finally generating run_executable.out. Next, take hint from the jobscripts (openmp.cmd or openmpscript.sh) provided to run the executable on a cluster or a local system.
